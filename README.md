## Benchmarks

Measured on MacBook Pro 2018, 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7. Some of the available SIMD instruction sets include SSE, SSE2, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX1.0.

You can also check out [latest CI runs](https://github.com/garlicbreadcleric/parsing-sandbox/actions) to see benchmarks for specific commits. These are ran in the cloud so don't expect the numbers to be the same as in local measurements listed below.

Note that hyperfine measurements include time needed to read file contents into memory. This is done on purpose to see how much the performance differences of various parsing methods are watered down by I/O performance.

## Discussion

- Built-in character counting (`input.chars().count()`) is quite fast. I wonder if it does any vectorization under the hood as well? I should look into that and see if that's the case and if I can use the same techniques to increase parsing performance boost from vectorization.
  - Built-in character counting does have an optimized version (`do_count_chars`) with some binary magic, but it only seems to be used for very long strings. This is the code for counting short strings:

    ```rust
    fn char_count_general_case(s: &[u8]) -> usize {
        s.iter().filter(|&&byte| !super::validations::utf8_is_cont_byte(byte)).count()
    }
    ```

    So, it does exactly the same thing as my scalar counter, and yet is several times faster on benchmarks (even after I changed my `is_continuation_byte` implementation to match `utf8_is_cont_byte`) and so far I have no idea why.
  - I also tried changing `get_character_width` to match `utf8_char_width` (using a table of widths instead of comparisons), but that made scalar byte parser almost twice slower, so I reverted that.
- For some reason, `parse.utf32.vector256` turns out to be much slower than `parse.utf32.byte`. When I started to measure parsing I at first thought one of the reasons is that lookup hits happen more often[^lookup-hit] (since a 32-byte slice is more likely to include a special character that forces the parser to switch to scalar mode, than a 16-byte slice), but character counting benchmarks hint that this is not true as they don't involve any such lookups at all.
- `parse.utf32.vector128` and `parse.utf32.vector128portable` are significatly (2-4 times) faster than `parse.utf32.byte` on inputs with greater average distance between lookup hits, but on inputs with very dense lookup hits performance is the same as `parse.utf32.byte` (or even slightly worse). In other words, vectorization shines on inputs with longer lines that have less square brackets in them.
  - This means that the performance boost from vectorization might be less significant for an actual Markdown parser, as there will be more lookup hits (and more false-positives as well).
    - On the other hand, CommonMark is parsed [in two passes](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#appendix-a-parsing-strategy) with different lookups and the first pass probably won't have a lot of lookup hits so I think vectorization will still give a significant boost there.
- Even though `count.vector128portable` is noticeably slower than `count.vector128`, the speed of parsing is exactly the same between `parse.utf32.vector128` and `parse.utf32.vector128portable`. I should look into the differences in ASM output for character counting.
- Distributing workload between multiple threads made a much bigger difference than vectorization. Also, it took like two lines of code, whereas vectorization requires a custom parser implementation for every supported character encoding.

- [SIMDized check which bytes are in a set](http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-byte-lookup.html) â€” a blog post that describes some more advanced lookup techniques that I didn't have to use in this toy parser but might need when I try to parse a more complicated grammar with more symbols to look for.

[^lookup-hit]: "Lookup hit" occurs when there's either a square bracket or a newline in the next 16/32 bytes. Whenever lookup hit happens the parser switches to scalar mode to process these 16/32 bytes one by one, and then returns to vector mode.

[^utf16-bytes-parser]: `parse.utf16.bytes` parser uses simdutf for counting characters, so it's not a "fair" comparison to `parse.utf32.bytes`.
